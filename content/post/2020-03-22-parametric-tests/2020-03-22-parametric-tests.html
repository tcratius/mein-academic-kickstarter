<p>In both statistic and to some extend maths, the concept of linearity is particularly important first step in knowing your data. It will define the parametric or non parametric tools you can use on the dataset and considering there are at least 75 tools that make up parametric testing, understanding the form of your data is a crucial first step in analysis <span class="citation">[1]</span>. In the case of hypothetical testing for research writing, having your data in guassian normal distribution is necessary for certain statical tests. In areas like engineering and computer science, knowing what form your data is in will influence the algoritms you use. For instance, in Singular Value Decomposition equation assumes linearity which is also know as both guassian normal and the dataset is therefore parametric in regression analysis.</p>
